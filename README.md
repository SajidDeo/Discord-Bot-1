# Discord-Bot-1
This is a Discord bot using the Java Discord API as well as the WebDriver API from Selenium. 

What this bot does is that whenever someone sends a link in a text channel, the bot will grab every single image from the link and send it back into the text channel.

You'll need the selenium library for Java, the JDA library, and the apache commons IO library for the bot to work.
